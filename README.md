This is the OpenGL/GLFW application that renders 3-dimensional pipe.

Pipe's length, thickness and internal radius are specified by user.
Wall thickness can be dynamically changed using mouse scroll.
Pipe's length can be dynamically changed using UP and DOWN arrow keys.
The pipe can be rotated with mouse pointer movements.

Use CMake to build the code.
